        <h2>Super Junior - A Legendary Korean Boyband</h2>

        <p>I started following Super Junior since middle school. The Kpop band originally had 13 members but down to 10 active ones at the moment. They were best known for excellent choreography and vocals. However, they are not as popular as they used to be. Most of the members established their own business and the band has not been united frequently anymore.</p>
